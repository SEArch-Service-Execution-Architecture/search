.. A simple example based on a sort of ping-pong protocol

repeat Ping {               ... after a few ping-pong exchanges
  Ping -> Pong: ping ;
  Pong -> Ping: pong
};
sel {                       ... the client closes the session
  Ping -> Pong: finished    ... either without expecting an acknowlegdgement from the server
  +
  Ping -> Pong: bye ;      ... or requiring an ack from the server
  Pong -> Ping: bye
}
